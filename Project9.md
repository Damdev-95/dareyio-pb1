## TOOLING WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION WITH CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION. INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS

DevOps is about Agility, and speedy release of software and web solutions. One of the ways to guarantee fast and repeatable deployments is Automation of routine tasks.
Acording to Circle CI, Continuous integration (CI) is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy. Developers continually commit code in small increments (at least daily, or even several times a day), which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.
n our project we are going to utilize Jenkins CI capabilities to make sure that every change made to the source code in GitHub https://github.com/Damdev-95/tooling will be automatically be updated to the Tooling Website.
