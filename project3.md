## SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK

In this project, to implement a web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

MERN Web stack consists of following components:
* MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
* ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.
* ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.
