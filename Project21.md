# ORCHESTRATING CONTAINERS ACROSS MULTIPLE VIRTUAL SERVERS WITH KUBERNETES. PART 

## Why migrate from Docker Compose to K8s
In the previous project you successfully deployed your Docker containers using Docker Compose, it is a great tool that helps avoiding execution of multiple CLI commands by preparing a declarative configuration file. It is handy when you deploy one or a few containers, but in most cases, it does not fit for production deployments.

Because of the many limitations that Docker Compose has, it is very important for us to consider migrating our solution to more an advanced technology. The most common alternatives to Compose, amongst a few others, are Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

## What is wrong with Docker Compose?
It is important to understand that, DevOps is about "Culture" and NOT "Tools" Therefore, it is not correct to say that one tool is better than another; different organizations have different needs and a good tool for one team may be bad for another just because their needs are not the same. In some teams, Docker Compose fit their needs perfectly, despite the perceived limitations. The major limitation of Docker Compose is that it can only be used to run workloads on a single computer host. Now, that is an obvious limitation because if our Tooling Application and its MySQL Database are all running on a single VM, like we did in Project 20, then this host is considered as a SPOF (i.e. – Single Point Of Failure).

So, could we say there is something wrong with Docker Compose? Not exactly, as a matter of fact, it is being used a lot in the industry. It fits well into some use cases that require speedy development and Proof of Concepts. As you will soon see, Kubernetes is a lot more complex technology, and it may be an overkill for some use cases.

# STEP 0-INSTALL CLIENT TOOLS BEFORE BOOTSTRAPPING THE CLUSTER.
First, you will need some client tools installed and configurations made on your client workstation:

awscli – is a unified tool to manage your AWS services
kubectl – this command line utility will be your main control tool to manage your K8s cluster. You will use this tool so many times, so you will be able to type ‘kubetcl’ on your keyboard with a speed of light. You can always make a shortcut (alias) to just one character ‘k’. Also, add this extremely useful official kubectl Cheat Sheet to your bookmarks, it has examples of the most used ‘kubectl’ commands.
cfssl – an open source toolkit for everything TLS/SSL from Cloudflare
cfssljson – a program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.
Install and configure AWS CLI
Configure AWS CLI to access all AWS services used, for this you need to have a user with programmatic access keys configured in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):
